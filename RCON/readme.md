Simple program to interact with the console of a minecraft server via RCON. This is only suitable for local servers as RCON is not encrypted and vunerable to attacks. But it will work over the net if required.

The purpose of rcon.txt is so you can put your rcon password in there. Make it as big as possible!
You will need the minecraft libary from mojang in order to use RCON.
Just make sure to change the IP and put your password in the .txt file. Place the txt file in the same directory as RCON.py
